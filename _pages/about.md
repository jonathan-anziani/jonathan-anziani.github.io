Hello, I'm Jonathan Anziani!

I am an MIT Class of 2025 graduate with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, concentrating in Industrial Design. Over my time at MIT, I developed a hands-on engineering mindset, being excited to turn a theoretical concept into a physical reality. My engineering interests include product design, research and development, and machine design.

Outside of engineering, I am a fire-performer specializing in contact staff, and if you're interested in that, check out the performances tab!<br>
