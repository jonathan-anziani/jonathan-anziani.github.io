For MIT's Medical Device Design class, I worked in a team of seven to design a force-controlled automated massage device that measures muscle stiffness in real-time. Professional massages increase athletic performance and recovery but are inaccessible due to demand exceeding the number of trained clinicians, so our sports-industry sponsor proposed developing a device that can replicate these techniques.

I was primarily responsible for the load analysis of the structure and the power transmission design. For the load analysis, I modeled the yeilding and buckling failure criterion using a spreadsheet to easily tabulate and communicate the calculations to teammates and project mentors.


## Overlay filter

You can use it by specifying the opacity (between 0 and 1) of a black overlay like so:

![transparent black overlay]({{ "/assets/images/mm-header-overlay-black-filter.jpg" | relative_url }})
