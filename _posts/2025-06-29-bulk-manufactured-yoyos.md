50 yo-yos designed and manufactured for Manufacturing and Design II. Each half of the yo-yo consists of an injection molded ring and base press fit together, with a bearing and fidget spinner attathed to the ring. I designed the fidget spinner and with that I had to design the press-fit diameters between the ring, bearing, and fidget spinner.

I was responsible for the CAD, CAM, and CNC milling of some of the molds, which were designed to take into account shrinkage of the injected plastic.

None of the press fits failed after a 4 foot drop test of all 50 yoyos as a result of our design tolerances.
