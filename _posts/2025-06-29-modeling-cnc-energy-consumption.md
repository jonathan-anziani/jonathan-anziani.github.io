This underwater vision assistance device was designed in a team of twelve to allow commercial divers see underwater in low-light, high-particulate situations.

Two cameras, a screen, and a pair of lenses are housed in a waterproof aluminum case designed to mount onto the industry standard Kirby-Morgan diving helmet.

I mostly focused on the mechanical design and fabrication of the prototype. For the final prototype, I designed a component mounting bracket that minimizes overall product size while still being removable and replacable. I also designed a faceplate that would fit snugly with the faceshield of the Kirby-Morgan helmet, improving visual clarity by reducing the water gap. Additionally, I assisted the electrical sub-team by testing and choosing the final cameras used in the prototype based on hardware compatability.
